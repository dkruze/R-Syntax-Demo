This demo was made to show off some of the irregularities in the syntax of R, for people who have never seen it.
It includes a simple function that performs command-line tasks, just as any procedural language would, as well as a series of graph generation functions and a 
  statistical analysis of a built-in set, with some library calls.
To run this on an R-compatible environment, nothing unexpected should occur: simply download it, place it in your preferred directory, and run.
Be sure you have some way to view PDF files to view the results of the graph generators (google chrome can do this if you don't have Adobe Acrobat,) and please
  note that this file was created and tested using Replit.com.
